The commands make, send, receive, view and queue may be
abbreviated to their first characters (e.g. ``fax q'').
<P>
Assignments of the form <I>VARIABLE</I><B>=</B><I>value</I> may appear
before the command name to temporarily change the values of most
fax script variables (e.g. ``fax PAGE=A4 print letter.001'')

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>fax</B> provides a simple user interface to the <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+efax">efax</A>(1) and
<A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+efix">efix</A>(1) programs.  It allows you to send text or Postscript files
as faxes and receive, print or preview received faxes.  The
<B>fax help</B> command prints a summary of the possible commands.
<P>
To send a fax, the original files need to be converted from ASCII
or Postscript into a particular bit-map format (TIFF with Group 3
encoding).  This can be done automatically by the <B>fax send</B>
command or you can use the <B>fax make</B> command to do the
conversion before sending the fax.  The conversion will create
one file per page.  These files will have the name of the
original file with the page number as an additional suffix.  For
example, running <B>fax make doc.ps</B> on the two-page postscript
file doc.ps would generate the files doc.ps.001 and doc.ps.002.
<P>
When sending a fax with the <B>fax send</B> command you may dial
the number manually and use the <B>-m</B> option or you may give
the phone number on the command line.  The names of the files to
be sent are given on the command line, usually by using
wildcards.  For example, to send a multi-page fax consisting of
the files doc.ps.001, doc.ps.002, and so on, you could use the
command <B>fax send 555-1212 doc.ps.0*</B> (if you had already run
the <B>fax make</B> command) or simply <B>fax send 555-1212
doc.ps</B>.  If the number is busy the script will wait and try
again.
<P>
Use the <B>fax receive</B> command to answer the phone and receive
a fax.  If a file name is specified the received fax will be
stored in files with the given file name plus an extension equal
to the page number.  If no options are given, the received fax
will be stored in files having a name given by the date and time
and an extension equal to the page number.  For example, a fax
received beginning on July 4 at 3:05:20 pm will generate files
0704150520.001, 0704150520.002, and so on.
<P>
The <B>fax print</B>, <B>fax view</B>, and <B>fax rm</B> commands
are used to print, preview or remove received fax files.  As with
the send command the file names are usually given using
wildcards.
<P>
If efax has been installed for automatic fax reception you can
use the <B>fax queue</B> command to check for files in the
incoming spool directory.  For convenience the <B>fax print</B>,
<B>view</B> and <B>rm</B> commands will first check for the named
files in this spool directory.  The <B>fax status</B> command
shows the status of the automatic receive process once, or every
<I>t</I> seconds.  Privileged users can use the <B>fax stop</B> and
<B>fax start</B> commands to stop and restart the fax reception
daemon.
<P>
The <B>fax answer</B> command is used for unattended reception of
faxes.  It is normally run automatically by <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+init">init</A>(8).  The <B>fax
wait</B> command simply calls <B>fax answer</B> repeatedly in a
loop to emulate <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+init">init</A>(8) for occasional use or for testing before
installation in <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+inittab">inittab</A>(5) or <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+ttytab">ttytab</A>(5).  Note that using <B>fax
wait</B> may not allow incoming data calls with some versions of
<A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+login">login</A>(1).
<P>
The <B>fax cut</B> command cuts out a rectangular portion of a fax
image and writes it to the standard output.  This image can then
be pasted into other faxes as described below or the efix program
can be used to convert the image into Encapsulated Postscript
(EPS) format for use with other applications. The <I>d</I> and
<I>r</I> arguments give the location of top left corner of the
area to cut out while <I>w</I> and <I>h</I> give the width and
height.  For example, the command <B>fax cut -l 24 22 44 12 mm
30Nov223513.001 &gt;sig.l</B> would cut a 44x12 millimeter rectangle
out of the low-resolution fax file 30Nov223513.001 and save it in
the file sig.l.
<P>
The <B>fax paste</B> commands allows you to paste one fax image
into others.  This is useful for adding signatures, letterhead,
or graphics to your faxes.  The <I>d</I> and <I>r</I> arguments
give the shift of the pasted-in image <I>d</I>own and to the
<I>r</I>ight. For example, <B>fax paste 8 4 sig.l order.001</B>
would shift the image in the file sig.l down by 8 inches and
right 4 inches and then paste it into the file order.001.  Use an
option of <B>in</B>, <B>cm</B>, <B>mm</B>, or <B>pt</B> after the
location for other units (e.g. ``fax paste 20 10 mm ...'').
<P>
The <B>fax test</B> command extracts configuration information
from the fax script and queries the fax modem for manufacturer,
model and capability information.  When reporting problems with
fax or efax please redirect the output of the <B>fax test</B>
command to a file (e.g. <B>fax test &gt;debug.out</B>) and submit
this file with your bug report.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RESOLUTION</H2>

<P>
Faxes can be created at low (98 lines per inch) or high (196 lpi)
resolution.  Almost all fax machines will operate at either
resolution.  By default files are created at high resolution but
you can use the optional <B>-l</B> argument to create files at low
resolution.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SESSION LOGS</H2>

<P>
The modem commands and responses together with status and error
messages are written to file.  If the fax is successfully sent or
received the log file is removed.  Otherwise a message is printed
showing the log file name.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<P>
The fax script will `source' the optional shell scripts
<B>/etc/efax.rc</B>, <B>~/.efaxrc</B> and/or <B>./.efaxrc</B> before
processing command-line arguments.  These files can be used to
set script variables to custom values for a particular host, user
and/or directory.
<P>
The following files are created in the FAXDIR spool directory
when automatic fax reception is enabled (see the fax script).
DEV represents the name of the fax modem device file in /dev
(e.g. cua1 for /dev/cua1).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>DEV.<I>n</I><DD>
the log file created by the fax answer daemon with process id
<I>n</I>
<DT>DEV.log<DD>
contains collected log files for device DEV.  Log files showing a
termination status of 1 (device busy) or 4 (no response from
modem) are not added to this file.
<DT>DEV.stop<DD>
created by the fax stop command to prevent the fax daemon from
starting up.
